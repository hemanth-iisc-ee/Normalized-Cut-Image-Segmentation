# Normalized-Cut-Image-Segmentation
Normalized Cuts is a Grapgh segmentation/clustering technique. It is generally used for image segmenattion problems. The technique is also known as Spectral Clustering.

A weighted graph is split into disjoint sets (groups) where by some measure the similarity within a group is high and that
across the group is low by minimizing the cost of the cut.

Normalized cut computes the cut cost by minizing the following function
